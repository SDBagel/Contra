# Contra

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SDBagel/Contra.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SDBagel/Contra)

Contra is an open source web application built around the traditional news media site, but adding in forum-style user interaction that encourages engagement.

Contra is built on ASP.NET Core 3.x (MVC) and Entity Framework Core with support for Docker. 

This app aims to challenge some aspects of Los Altos High School's newspaper, The Talon, which currently faces a few issues. It does not intend to replace it and instead, aims to provide a forum of discussion for our community.
